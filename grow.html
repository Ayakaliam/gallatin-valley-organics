                <h1 class="header-text contact thin">Prioritizing Sustainability</h1>
                <p>Being at the forefront of the emerging cannabis industry in Montana, we know it is our responsibility
                    to prioritize sustainability and reduce waste in all our practices, from our cultivation methods to
                    our packaging procedures.</p>

                <p>Valuing sustainability begins at our garden, where our talented gardeners use organic OMRI certified
                    nutrients and liquid organics in the soil. These growth methods eliminate the need to use reverse
                    osmosis water filtration, allowing us to reduce our overall water usage. Additionally, our cannabis
                    is grown using LED’s, which saves power and increases the potency of both THC and Terpene levels.
                    Our sustainability measures even extend to our pest management practices, where we use an OMRI
                    certified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) regiment that harnesses environmentally sensitive pest
                    prevention and treatment. </p>

                <p>Placing an emphasis on sustainability doesn’t stop at the way we cultivate our cannabis. We continue
                    these practices at the storefront with our packaging and handling of day to day operations. Our weed
                    is served “deli style” from glass jars to preserve freshness, packaged in front of each customer in
                    reusable glass jars or rice paper bags, and sealed in a biodegradable exit bag. Our in-house
                    cartridges are glass with ceramic coil and tips, and even our joint tubes are biodegradable. We
                    strive to eliminate all single use packaging. Here at Gallatin Valley Organics, we believe that
                    every small action makes a big impact, and we are excited to lead the charge on sustainable
                    practices in the cannabis industry in Montana and beyond.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>At Gallatin Valley Organics, we take pride in offering clean, natural, high-quality marijuana
                    products. Growing organic cannabis is how we do our part in creating a healthier and more
                    sustainable industry for everyone. Organic cannabis is cultivated without the use of synthetic
                    chemicals, which not only eliminates consumer exposure to harmful residues, but also reduces
                    negative impacts on soil, water, and ecosystems. And the benefits of organic cultivation don’t stop
                    there: utilizing organic soil amendments and natural pest control practices can enhance a plant’s
                    terpene and cannabinoid profile, resulting in more flavorful marijuana with improved medicinal
                    properties. At our own Gallatin Valley Organics garden, we use as many organic cultivation methods
                    as possible, including:</p>

                    <li class="bullets">Conserving water by using liquid organics, eliminating the need to use reverse
                        osmosis for water
                        filtration</li>
                    <li class="bullets">Conserving electricity by using LED lights</li>
                    <li class="bullets">Adhering to OMRI specific organic standards and maintaining detailed records
                    </li>

                <h1 class="header-text contact thin">What is OMRI?</h1>
                <p>The Organic Materials Review Institute, commonly known as OMRI, is an international nonprofit
                    organization that provides an independent review of products and inputs that are intended to be used
                    in certified organic production and processing. These reviews provide guidance and create a standard
                    of integrity so producers know what products can be used for organic operations. The inputs assessed
                    by OMRI include things like fertilizers, pest controls, and livestock health care products. Once
                    these input products are verified by OMRI, they become “OMRI Listed®”, and can then be used to
                    produce food and fiber products that qualify to be certified as organic by an accredited certifying
                    body.</p>
